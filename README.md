# VSRFM
## Variant Stacked Random Forest Model and Variant Stacked Random Forest Model for splicing.

We present Variants Stacked Random Forest Model (VSRFM) and Variants Stacked Random Forest Model for splicing (VSRFM-s), two methods for pathogenic variant detection. Both  are random forest models trained over ensemble scores, considering minor frequency allele from gnomAD and splice/no-splice condition. VSRFM was trained in not-splice variants and  VSRFM-s in splice variants. Comparing VSRFM and VSRFM-s with their constituent scores, showed the best outcomes:
